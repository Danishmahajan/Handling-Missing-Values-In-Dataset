<b>Why Do You Need To Handle Missing Values</b><br>

## Some Imputations Methods Are :<br>
### 1.Continuous Variables Imputations:
>Random Imputation<br>
>Mean/Median/mode Imputation<br>
>Capturing NAN values with a new Feature Imputation<br>
>End of Distribution Imputation<br>
>Arbitrary Value Imputation<hr>



### 2.Categorical Imputation:
>Frequent Category Imputation<br>
>Capturing NAN by adding a new Feature<br>
>Adding a Missing Category<br>
